## Background

Yieldy is a staking rewards system that allows token holders the ability to stake the corresponding token into a smart contract in order to receive rewards denominated in the Yieldy version of that token.  For instance, if you have wETH and want to stake it into the wETH Yieldy staking contract, you will stake your wETH and receive wETHy back.  Yieldies are ERC20, rebasing tokens that are redeemable 1:1 with their corresponding token.  Yieldy rewards are generated by the staking system are provided to the contract via swapping Tokemak's TOKE rewards on chain through cowswap.  The ultimate goal of the yieldy project is to enable a variety of token holders to have a simplified interface in which to earn yield on their tokens that outperforms other avenues available to them without active management.


## High level architecture 
### Based on a Yieldy contract in which FOX is the base token

## Local development

### Run Tests

1. `yarn`
2. `yarn compile`
3. `yarn test` or `yarn coverage` will run the basic test examples.

### Other Commands

`yarn local-node` - used to run your own forked mainnet node locally

`yarn local-init` - used to initialize local-node and set up the FOXy contracts to use locally

`yarn local-mine` - used to mine to the next Tokemak cycle as well as sendWithdrawalRequests and rebase
